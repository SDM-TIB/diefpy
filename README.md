# diefpy
Python package for computing diefficiency metrics dief@t and dief@k.

The metrics dief@t and dief@k allow for measuring the diefficiency during an elapsed time period t or while k answers are produced, respectively. dief@t and dief@k rely on the computation of the area under the curve of answer traces, and thus capturing the answer rate concentration over a time interval.
